# Contributions

Every member has to complete at least 2 meaningful tasks per week, where a
single development task should have a granularity of 0.5-1 day. The completed
tasks have to be shown in the weekly TA meetings. You have one "Joker" to miss
one weekly TA meeting and another "Joker" to once skip continuous progress over
the remaining weeks of the course. Please note that you cannot make up for
"missed" continuous progress, but you can "work ahead" by completing twice the
amount of work in one week to skip progress on a subsequent week without using
your "Joker". Please communicate your planning **ahead of time**.

Note: If a team member fails to show continuous progress after using their
Joker, they will individually fail the overall course (unless there is a valid
reason).

**You MUST**:

- Have two meaningful contributions per week.

**You CAN**:

- Have more than one commit per contribution.
- Have more than two contributions per week.
- Link issues to contributions descriptions for better traceability.

**You CANNOT**:

- Link the same commit more than once.
- Use a commit authored by another GitHub user.

By creating the MovieController and associated endpoints, I enable frontend to search, retrieve, and view detailed movie information. |

By integrating the endpoint that fetches genre information, the application can offer users additional filtering criteria. This enhances the search functionality and improves user experience by enabling genre-based exploration of movies. I ensured that invalid queries are properly managed. This leads to more robust and user-friendly interactions during movie searches. I created the logic for communicating with the TMDb API, mapping responses to the Movie entity, and providing detailed movie information. |
